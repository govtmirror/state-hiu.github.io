The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\n### ROGUE\r\nThe Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### MapGive\r\nMapGive, an initiative of the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Humanitarian Information Unit, makes it easy for new volunteers to learn to map and get involved in online tasks.\r\n\r\nhttp://mapgive.state.gov\r\n\r\n### Imagery to the Crowd\r\nThe Imagery to the Crowd Initiative (ITTC) is a core initiative of the Humanitarian Information Unit. Through ITTC, HIU publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, purchased by the United States Government, in a web-based format that can be easily mapped by volunteers. These imagery services are used by volunteers to add baseline geographic data into OpenStreetMap, such as roads and buildings. The imagery processing pipeline is built from opensource applications, such as TileCache and GeoServer. All tools developed by HIU for ITTC, are also open source, such as this repo.\r\n\r\nhttp://mapgive.state.gov/ittc\r\n\r\n### Secondary Cities\r\nMapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency, Human Security, and Emergency Preparedness is the flagship, field-based initiative of the Office of the Geographer.\r\n- Building partnerships to create geospatial data on secondary cities\r\n- Enhancing understanding of secondary cities through data and mapping\r\n- Building local capacity in geospatial science-based decision making\r\n- Providing open geospatial data solutions\r\n- Facilitating long-term secondary city partnerships and networks\r\n\r\nhttp://secondarycities.state.gov\r\n\r\n## Websites\r\n\r\n### State GeoNode\r\nPrimary open geographic data platform of the U.S. Department of State\r\n\r\nhttp://geonode.state.gov\r\n\r\n### Ebola GeoNode\r\nThis is a partnership platform for sharing geospatial data, analysis and maps related to the Ebola emergency response. The platform is intended to minimize the time that GIS analysts spend locating up-to-date data. Users are able to make maps on the fly, view metadata, and access the reports behind GIS layers. Curators are working to ensure that the layers are recent, clean, useful, and legally and technically open.\r\n\r\nhttp://ebolageonode.org\r\n\r\n### Cusco GeoNode\r\nThe Cusco GeoNode is a geospatial platform provided by the U.S. Department of State, Humanitarian Information Unit as part of the Secondary Cities project. The Cusco GeoNode is used for collaborating on and sharing geospatial data among the US Government and partners in Peru.
